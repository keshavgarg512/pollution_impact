            <h2>Special Plants That Support Pollinators</h2>
            <p>
                Certain plants play a vital role in supporting pollinators by providing them with essential resources such as nectar, pollen, and shelter. Growing these plants in gardens and green spaces can create a haven for bees, butterflies, birds, and other pollinators, helping to sustain their populations.

                Creating a garden with a variety of flowering plants, shrubs, and trees is one of the most effective ways to support pollinators. Here are some tips to help you design a pollinator-friendly garden:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plant a Mix of Bloom Times:</strong> Choose plants that bloom at different times of the year to provide food for pollinators throughout the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Include Native Species:</strong> Native plants are more likely to attract local pollinators and thrive in your climate.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Pesticides:</strong> Many pesticides harm pollinators. Opt for natural pest control methods to keep your garden safe.</li>
