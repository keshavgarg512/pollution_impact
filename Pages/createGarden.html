            <h2>Create a Pollinator-Friendly Garden</h2>
            <p>
                Pollinators, including bees, butterflies, birds, and bats, need our help. By creating a pollinator-friendly
                garden, you can provide a safe haven for these crucial creatures and help them thrive. Follow these simple steps
                to transform your outdoor space into a pollinator paradise!
            </p>

            <h3>1. Choose Native Plants</h3>
            <p>
                Native plants are the foundation of a pollinator-friendly garden. They provide the right food and shelter
                for local pollinators and are well-adapted to the local environment. Some great choices include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunflowers</li>
                <li>Lavender</li>
                <li>Echinacea</li>
                <li>Milkweed (for Monarch butterflies)</li>
                <li>Bee balm</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Provide a Variety of Flower Shapes and Colors</h3>
            <p>
                Different pollinators are attracted to different types of flowers. Include a mix of flower shapes (tubular,
                bell-shaped, daisy-like) and a range of colors to attract bees, butterflies, and birds. Bright colors like
                yellow, purple, and red are particularly appealing.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Avoid Pesticides and Herbicides</h3>
            <p>
                Pesticides and herbicides are harmful to pollinators. Choose organic or natural pest control methods, such as
                hand-picking pests or using neem oil, which is safe for beneficial insects.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Add Water Sources</h3>
            <p>
                Pollinators need water just like other creatures. Add a shallow birdbath, pond, or water dish to your garden.
                Make sure the water is fresh and changed regularly to avoid breeding mosquitoes.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Provide Shelter and Nesting Sites</h3>
            <p>
                Pollinators need places to rest and nest. Include tall plants, trees, and shrubs that provide shelter from wind
                and predators. You can also create small bee hotels, which provide safe nesting sites for solitary bees.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Plant for Year-Round Bloom</h3>
            <p>
                Different pollinators are active at different times of the year. Plant a variety of species that bloom at
                different times to provide food for pollinators throughout the seasons. Early bloomers like crocuses are great
                for early spring, while asters and goldenrod can provide food well into autumn.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Educate Your Community</h3>
            <p>
                Share your knowledge about pollinators and encourage your neighbors to create pollinator-friendly gardens
                as well. Collective action can make a huge difference in protecting pollinators in your area.
