            <h2>Understanding Pollution</h2>
            <p>Pollution affects every corner of our environment, and its impact on pollinators is alarming. Here, we explore different types of pollution and how each affects pollinators and their ecosystems.</p>
            
            <!-- Pollution Types Section -->

                    <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Air pollution, primarily caused by vehicle emissions and industrial activities, releases harmful toxins into the atmosphere. These toxins can impair the health of pollinators and reduce their ability to forage effectively.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Water Pollution -->
                <div class="pollution-card">
                    <h3>Water Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Contaminants from agriculture, factories, and households pollute water sources. When pollinators consume polluted water, their health deteriorates, impacting their survival rates and population stability.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Soil Pollution -->
                <div class="pollution-card">
                    <h3>Soil Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Pollutants from pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals accumulate in the soil. This not only harms the plants pollinators rely on but also affects the health of pollinators that come into contact with contaminated soil.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Light Pollution -->
                <div class="pollution-card">
                    <h3>Light Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Excessive artificial lighting disrupts the natural behaviors of nocturnal pollinators, such as moths. This interference affects pollination cycles and the biodiversity of ecosystems.</p>
